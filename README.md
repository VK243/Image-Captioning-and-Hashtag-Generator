# AI-Powered Image Captioning and Hashtag Generation Tool

This project is an AI-powered tool that uses the Hugging Face model API and OpenAI API to automatically generate captions and hashtags for images. The tool uses advanced image recognition technology to analyze the image and generate a text description that is then used as input to the OpenAI API to generate captions and hashtags.

## Features

- Automatically tags images based on their content
- Generates multiple captions that accurately describe the image
- Provides ten hashtags with maximum reach based on the tags generated
- Offers an intuitive user interface where anyone can upload an image and get AI-generated captions and tags

## Technologies Used

- Hugging Face model API for image recognition and text conversion
- OpenAI API for caption and hashtag generation
- Python for building the tool
- Streamlit for creating the user interface

## Requirements

- Python 3.6 or above
- Hugging Face API credentials
- OpenAI API credentials
- Streamlit package
